# React Native FlatList rendering issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using FlatList in React Native: the component remains empty even after successfully fetching data from an API. The `DataFetch` component fetches data from a public API and updates its state accordingly; however, the FlatList fails to render items.  The solution provided addresses this issue, offering a functional and efficient approach to displaying fetched data.
